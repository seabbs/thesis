Description: Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of
    first-order ordinary differential equations ('ODE'), of partial
    differential equations ('PDE'), of differential algebraic equations
    ('DAE'), and of delay differential equations.  The functions
    provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar',
    'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN
    functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of
    solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time
    steps.  The package contains routines designed for solving 'ODEs'
    resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential equations
    ('PDE') that have been converted to 'ODEs' by numerical
    differencing.
