Description: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH
    key parsers. Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384 and
    P-521. Cryptographic signatures can either be created and verified
    manually or via x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc, ctr or
    gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key)
    encryption or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions
    combine RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other
    utilities include key generators, hash functions (md5, sha1,
    sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number generator, and
    'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto calculations
    on large multibyte integers.
