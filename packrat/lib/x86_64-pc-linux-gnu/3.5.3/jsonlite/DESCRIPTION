Description: A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical
    data and the web. Started out as a fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been
    completely rewritten in recent versions. The package offers
    flexible, robust, high performance tools for working with JSON in R
    and is particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting
    with a web API. The implementation is based on the mapping
    described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to converting
    JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to
    stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included
    with the package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded
    consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
