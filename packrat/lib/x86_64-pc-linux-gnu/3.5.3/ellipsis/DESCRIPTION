Package: ellipsis
Version: 0.1.0
Title: Tools for Working with ...
Description: In S3 generics, it's useful to take ... so that methods
    can have additional argument. But this flexibility comes at a cost:
    misspelled arguments will be silently ignored. The ellipsis
    packages is an experiment that allows a generic to warn if any
    arguments passed in ... are not used.
