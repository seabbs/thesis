Title: Interface to Unidata netCDF (Version 4 or Earlier) Format Data
    Files
Author: David Pierce <dpierce@ucsd.edu>
Maintainer: David Pierce <dpierce@ucsd.edu>
Description: Provides a high-level R interface to data files written
    using Unidata's netCDF library (version 4 or earlier), which are
    binary data files that are portable across platforms and include
    metadata information in addition to the data sets.  Using this
    package, netCDF files (either version 4 or "classic" version 3) can
    be opened and data sets read in easily.  It is also easy to create
    new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files, in either version 3 or
    4 format, and manipulate existing netCDF files.  This package
    replaces the former ncdf package, which only worked with netcdf
    version 3 files.  For various reasons the names of the functions
    have had to be changed from the names in the ncdf package.  The old
    ncdf package is still available at the URL given below, if you need
    to have backward compatibility.  It should be possible to have both
    the ncdf and ncdf4 packages installed simultaneously without a
    problem.  However, the ncdf package does not provide an interface
    for netcdf version 4 files.
